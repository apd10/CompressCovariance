inserting-nonzero : we can only estimate E(XY)
verify-topk : we can only do precision analysis
inserting-all : we can keep an array of \mu (updated in a streaming fashion) and try to estimate E((X-\mu1 )(Y-\mu2))

inserting-nonzero
  will require that the mean of each feature is very close to zero. it should work for very sparse datasets.

verify-all
  This experiment is possible with only countsketch without the heap. we can measure the exact precision recall curve / f1 score etc.

verify-topk
  In these experiments, it wont be possible for us to do a recall measurement because it is just not possible to do a pairwise comparison
